### Ryan D Burns

Hello. My name is Ryan and I'm 37. I was inspired to get my masters after reading Life 3.0, which went into detail about AI and it's potential benefits and downfalls, but ultimately it's our responsibility to create the right kind of AI that makes our world a better and more equitable place. I love learning new things and pushing through my own fear to better myself. I hope that I become a better developer after these 14 weeks.

### Ignacio Moral

Hello. My name is Ignacio Moral. I am an exchange student from Instituto Tecnologico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey, in Mexico City.<br>
I originally registered for class CS 473, but since there's few students registered for it, and it's taught in conjunction, I ended in CS 673.<br>
I am in my seventh semester of the Engineering of Computational Technologies (ITC for its Spanish initials) in my country.<br>

### Chenfei (Christol) Yu

Hi my name is Chenfei Yu and I prefer to go with Christol. I've just recieved my Bachelor's degree in Physics in June, and I'm pursuing Master's degree in software development in BU. During my undergraduate I did a research intern about machine learning + physics, and I felt like more enthusiastic about programming rather than physics research, which made me decide to transfer to software area. I've been working in a startup as a part-time frontend developer and engineering manager for a couple of months, and I find there is so much to learn about software engineering. I wish to become more qualified for a developer after this course.
